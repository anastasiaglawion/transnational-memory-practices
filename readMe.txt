In this repository, coding material and scripts for the dissertation "Practices of transnational memory - a mixed methods approach to the study of a historical online forum" by Anastasia Glawion are gathered. 

The repository contains the following code: 
linklistWordoverlap.R: Loop for creating linklists out of MALLET diagnostics. Linklists can be implemented in a network analysis software.
mallet_script.txt : Commands for the topic model creation with MALLET. 
visLocationPerCluster.R: Commands for the visualizations of metadata (location)
visTimeframePerCluster.R: Commands for the visualizations of metadata (timeframe)
webscrapingFunctions.R: Functions created for web scraping the Axis History Forum (AHF).

The files "output_apify_location_ru.xlsx", "output_apify_location_us.xlsx", "output_apify_location_germany.xlsx"
contain the Google search results for keywords related to World War II with varying location settings (see Chapter 2.1. Online resources dedicated to World War II: An overview). 

The files "userThread_clX.graphmlz" represent bimodal networks of users and threads of each cluster, which are analyzed in the final chapter. The node information contains, among other things, positional information on each node: structural equivalence, core, degree centrality.
